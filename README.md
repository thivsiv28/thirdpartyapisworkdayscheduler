# Third Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## The Task

#### We had to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying the starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.


## Application Criteria

- When using a daily planner to create a schedule,
WHEN I open the planner,
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
- WHEN I scroll down,
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.
- WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day,
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
- WHEN I click into a timeblock,
THEN I can enter an event.
- WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage.
- WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist.

## Mockup

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
